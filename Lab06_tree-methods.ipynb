        "In this assignment, you will explore three common formulations of the splitting criterion used in **CART (Classification and Regression Trees)** for **regression problems**:\n",

        "2. **RSS Gain Maximization**  \n",
        "3. **Total RSS Minimization**\n",

        "You will investigate whether any of these criteria are equivalent, and you will design an experiment to determine which criterion is actually employed in a standard implementation such as **scikit-learn’s DecisionTreeRegressor**.\n",

        "\n",
        "Many treatments of CART for regression describe the split selection process in different ways. Below are three frequently cited formulations. Suppose we have a dataset with features $X$ and target $y$, and we seek to choose a feature $X_j$ and a threshold $t$ to split the data into two regions $R_1(X_j, t)$ and $R_2(X_j, t)$. Denote by $\\bar{y}_{R_m}$ the mean of targets within region $R_m$.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Local RSS Minimization**  \n",

        "\n",

        "   $R_m$ set collects all data indices $i$ whose feature vector $x_i$ is classified into the leaf node $m$ when passed through the tree $T(X_j,t)$. In other words, each leaf node $m$ in $T(X_j, t)$ corresponds to a unique path of splits, and any data point $x_i$ that follows that path is assigned to the leaf $m$; hence, it belongs to $R_m$.\n",
